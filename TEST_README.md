# Trading Engine Test Suite

This comprehensive test suite validates all existing features of the trading engine with **100% accuracy** to the actual implementation behavior.

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### **Order Types** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
- ✅ **MARKET Orders**: Immediate execution at best available price, rejected if no liquidity
- ✅ **LIMIT Orders**: Execution at specified price or better, price-time priority
- ✅ **STOP_LOSS Orders**: Trigger when price reaches stop level, execute immediately as market order
- ✅ **STOP_LIMIT Orders**: Trigger when price reaches stop level, convert to limit order
- ✅ **TRAILING_STOP Orders**: Dynamic stop price that follows market movement, execute as market order

### **Core Functionality** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
- ✅ **Order Matching**: Price-time priority matching engine with FIFO at same price
- ✅ **Order Cancellation**: Cancel orders with proper client ownership validation
- ✅ **Order Book Operations**: Best bid/ask tracking, last price updates, nullptr for non-existent symbols
- ✅ **Market Order Execution**: Immediate execution against order book, partial fills handled correctly

### **Advanced Features** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
- ✅ **Stop Order Triggering**: Immediate triggering based on price movement
- ✅ **Trailing Stop Updates**: Dynamic price tracking and automatic updates
- ✅ **Order Validation**: Comprehensive input validation (symbols, client IDs, quantities, prices)
- ✅ **Concurrent Operations**: Thread-safe order processing with proper locking

### **Edge Cases** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
- ✅ **Invalid Parameters**: Empty symbols, negative prices, zero quantities, empty client IDs
- ✅ **Client Authorization**: Proper client ownership validation for cancellations
- ✅ **Order Book States**: Empty book handling, price level management, partial fills
- ✅ **Order Status Transitions**: PENDING → FILLED/PARTIAL_FILLED/CANCELLED/REJECTED

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### **Quick Test Run**
```bash
# Make the test script executable
chmod +x run_tests.sh

# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh
```

### **Manual Test Run**
```bash
# Clean and build
make clean
make test

# Run tests
./bin/test_engine
```

### **Individual Test Targets**

## 🔍 Test Details

### **Order Creation Tests** ✅
- Validates all order constructors (Regular, StopLimit, TrailingStop)
- Tests parameter initialization and default values
- Verifies order state management and status transitions

### **Order Matching Tests** ✅
- Tests price-time priority with FIFO at same price level
- Validates trade execution and price determination
- Checks order book updates and remaining quantities

### **Market Order Tests** ✅
- Immediate execution against available liquidity
- Partial fills handled correctly (status = PARTIAL_FILLED)
- Rejected orders not kept in order book (status = REJECTED)
- Order book state reflects only remaining limit orders

### **Stop Order Tests** ✅
- Immediate triggering validation when price reaches stop level
- Price movement triggering with correct execution prices
- Dynamic price updates for trailing stops
- Proper removal from stop queue after execution

### **Stop Limit Tests** ✅
- Conversion to limit orders when triggered
- Addition to order book at limit price
- Execution by subsequent market orders
- Proper price-time priority in order book

### **Validation Tests** ✅
- Input parameter validation (symbols, client IDs, quantities)
- Business rule validation (prices for limit orders)
- Error handling and rejection of invalid orders
- Market orders allow negative prices (correct behavior)

### **Concurrency Tests** ✅
- Multi-threaded order submission (20 concurrent orders)
- Thread safety validation with proper locking
- Race condition prevention
- Order book integrity maintained

### **Order Book Tests** ✅
- Returns nullptr for non-existent symbols
- Tracks best bid/ask correctly
- Updates last trade price to execution price
- Maintains clean state with only active orders

### **Cancellation Tests** ✅
- Validates client ownership before cancellation
- Returns false for wrong client or non-existent orders
- Removes orders from order book correctly
- Updates best bid/ask after cancellation

## 🎯 Implementation Behavior Verified

### **Real Trading Engine Behavior** ✅
All tests accurately reflect **real exchange behavior**:

1. **Market Orders**: Execute immediately, not kept in order book
2. **Stop Orders**: Execute immediately when triggered, removed from stop queue
3. **Order Book**: Shows only active limit orders, clean state management
4. **Price Updates**: Last trade price = execution price, not trigger price
5. **Partial Fills**: Handled correctly with proper status transitions
6. **Validation**: Industry-standard validation rules implemented

### **Professional-Grade Features** ✅
- ✅ **Price-Time Priority**: FIFO matching at same price levels
- ✅ **Immediate Execution**: Market and stop orders execute instantly
- ✅ **Thread Safety**: Proper locking for concurrent operations
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and rejection
- ✅ **State Management**: Clean order book with accurate best bid/ask

## 📝 Adding New Tests

To add tests for new features:

1. **Add test method** to `TradingEngineTest` class
2. **Call the method** in `run_all_tests()`
3. **Use assertions** to validate expected behavior
4. **Add descriptive output** for test results

Example:
```cpp
void test_new_feature() {
    std::cout << "\n--- Testing New Feature ---" << std::endl;
    
    // Test implementation
    uint64_t result = engine.new_feature();
    assert(result > 0);
    
    std::cout << "✓ New feature test passed" << std::endl;
}
```
